Netbeans Edit Externally

Allows opening the currently edited file in an external editor.


About
-----

Allows opening the currently edited file in an external editor.

Its main purpose is to open the currently edited file at the exact same cursor
position as in Netbeans to execute some complex editing action that is not
easily possible within Netbeans itself.

The command to open the file in an external editor must be supplied by the
user and allows placeholders to specify the location of the cursor to be
able to jump to the same location of the cursor in Netbeans' editor.

A fallback command can be specified for opening file for which no editor
window is open. This command doesn't support all the placeholders, but
allows editing a file directly from the Projects nodes.


Usage
-----

This plugin adds an Entry `Edit Externally` to the following menus:

 * Main Menu `Tools`
 * Context Menu of each editor window
 * Submenu `Tools` in the context popup menu of each node in the Projects view

Additionally an icon is placed in the `File` section of the main toolbar
and into the editors toolbar:

Configuration
-------------

The configuration panel can be found at
`Tools / Options / Miscellaneous / Edit Externally`.

There are two commands to be configured:

 - Edit externally
 - Open externally

This plugin decides which one to call based on the information it has about
the currently selected file. If an open editor for the file is found, the
`Edit externally` action is called as it allows including cursor location
information in the command.

If no associated editor is found, the `Open externally` action is called
instead.


=== Placeholders

The following placeholders can be used for both commands:

[horizontal]
${file}:: The absolute path to the file.
${fileName}:: The file name of the file.
${fileBasename}:: The file name of the file without extension.
${fileExt}:: The file extension of the file.

The following placeholders can additionally be used for the
`Edit externally` action:

[horizontal]
${line0}:: The line of the cursor location (0-based).
${line}:: The line of the cursor location (1-based).
${column0}:: The column of the cursor location (0-based).
${column}:: The column of the cursor location (1-based).
//${selectedText}:: The currently selected text.
//${selectionStart}:: The location of the selection start (number of chars).
//${selectionEnd}:: The location of the selection end (number of chars).


=== Quoting and Escaping

To allow command line arguments with spaces they can be enclosed within
single or double quotes. It is also possible to escape a single space or
quote character by preceding it with a backslash.

Backslashes take precedence over quote. Therefore it is possible to have
quotes as part of a quoted string like in this example:


----
myprogram 'my \'quoted\' string'
----


=== Examples

To call `vim` in an `urxvt` terminal the following configuration can be
used:

Edit externally:: `urxvt -e vim ${file} "+call cursor(${line}, ${column})"`
Open externally:: `urxvt -e vim ${file}`


=== Keybindings

This plugin registers an action with the name „Edit Externally“ in
Netbeans. It is recommended to provide a custom keybinding for that action
for faster access.


Known Issues
------------

* Multiple selected files are not supported at the moment.
+
If multiple files are selected in the Node tree, only one of them will get
opened in the configured editor.


Related plugins
---------------

This plugin is inspired by the following existing plugins.

QuickOpener::
  http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/62668/quickopener
+
This plugin shares some of the same ideas and does provides some
additional actions. Unfortunately it is quite buggy and not very handy.

Use System Desktop::
  http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/57462/netbeans-use-system-desktop
+
This plugin provides actions to open the currently selected file via the
operating systems default application. It lacks the ability to jump to a
specific cursor location, but may be used together with `Edit Externally`.
