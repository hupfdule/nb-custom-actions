 There is
   - xdg-open (XDG standard)
   - kde-open (KDE)
   - gnome-open (Gnome)
   - exo-open (Xfce)
   - enlightenment_open (Enlightenment)
   - what about LXDE?
xdg-open is a shell script that detects the current environment and calls
gnome-open, kde-open, etc. accordingly. Of course this doesnâ€˜t provide an
edit command.

 
There is also (sometimes)
 - x-terminal-emulator
 - xdg-terminal


== User interface

=== Functions

Each above mentioned command should be a function for which a keybinding
can be added.
Since both, NB-Use-System-Desktop and QuickOpener-NB have functions that
are provided in the keybinding config panel, this seems to work
out-of-the-box.

=== Menu entries

The main menu should normally not need any entry for this tool.

It may be nice to provide a context menu entry in the browser views for the
configured actions.

=== Icons

Each action should be given an icon that can be added to a toolbar.
Each icon can be disabled.

=== Configuration panel

A configuration panel is necessary to modify the available commands.
